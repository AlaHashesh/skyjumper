On the other side of the wormhole there was a light, but that wasn’t the light of happiness it was a new world in which Lucky is facing his new unlucky situation. In this world Lucky is falling and can’t see the end of his fall, while he can easily fall on his own, he can’t evade the new obstacles that began to arise.
